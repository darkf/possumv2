Possum is a scheme-inspired language that is designed to be concise and simple.
It features fixed-arity functions, enabling us to lose the mess of parentheses.

Here's a canonical factorial function:

defun fact n is
  cond
    = n 0
      1
    true
      * n fact - n 1
  end
end

print fact 10

You can write this on one line, two lines, or however many you want (although we recommend you indent your code nicely!)

Unfortunately, possum is at a very early stage in development, so expect bugs and things downright not working! (In other words, don't trust your life with it.)

Usage:
- Compile (probably fsc.exe possum.fsi possum.fs parser.fs main.fs) although a solution file for Visual Studio 2010 is included.
- Run: possum.exe test.ps
